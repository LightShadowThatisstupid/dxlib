# Updates

## DELETIONS AND NEW FEATURES

## **Deletions**
- Deleted the `dxlibLoops` namespace. Only kept `vectorLoop()` and placed it in `dxlibMain()`
- Deleted the `dxlibProbability` namespace and moved all its functions to the `dxlibRandom` namespace since its **redundant**

---

## **New Additions**
- Added a new convert function in `dxlibConvert`, the name is `ConvertIntToFloat`, Pretty simple it just converts an int to a float
- Added four new functions in `dxlibChecks`, these being are `isZero()`, `isHalf()`, `isMultTwo()`, and `isEqual()`. Please
  Check `dxHelp.hpp` to see how they work.
